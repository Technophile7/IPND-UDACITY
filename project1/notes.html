      <h1>Components of the <b>Web</b></h1>

 The computer running a <em>web browser, the Internet, and servers.</em>

the browser makes requests via the Internet to servers. These requests are using a protocol called HTTP. And the servers respond with files that the browser displays.

Some <em>examples</em> of browsers include Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Edge. 

These servers are computers just like yours except they are optimized for sitting in a closet and hosting files rather than sitting on your desk browsing these files. And the protocol HTTP is just a very simple protocol that your browser uses to communicate with these servers. We'll mostly be focusing on the browser component in this section for rendering HTML files.

    <h3>The <b>World Wide Web</b></h3>

    <p>The web is composed largely of HTML documents. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the language the browsers use to interpret web pages.</p><p> The components of the web include the client (your computer and browser), the Internet, and servers. The client and servers interact through something called the <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em> (HTTP).</p>

    
    <b>Basic HTML Elements</b>

HTML elements are what we use to tell a web browser how to display content on a web page.<br>Most HTML elements consist of an opening and a closing tag with some content between them. 


<h1><b>HTML</b> Attributes</h1>
Some elements accept additional values called attributes in their opening tags. Attributes provide additional information to the browser.<br> For example, the anchor tag takes an attribute called href that defines a URL to link to.



<h1>More HTML Elements</h1>
p tag Defines a paragraph. The content of the <p> element is in a "box"
br tagCreates a line break
div tag Creates a "box" container element
span Creates an "inline" container element
